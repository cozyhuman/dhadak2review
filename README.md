# Dhadak 2 Movie Review: Siddhant Chaturvedi Shines in a Poignant Tale

**Dhadak 2** emerges as a compelling and emotionally resonant film,
tackling the enduring issue of caste discrimination while delivering
memorable performances. Directed by Shazia Iqbal, the movie is a remake
of the Tamil classic *Pariyerum Perumal* and serves as a sequel to the
original *Dhadak*.

## Storyline

The film revolves around Nilesh (Siddhant Chaturvedi), a law student
from an oppressed caste, who falls in love with his classmate Vidhi
(Triptii Dimri), an upper-caste girl. Their romance faces fierce
opposition as members of Vidhi's family humiliate and harass Nilesh to
uphold their so-called "honour." The narrative also portrays the subtle
and overt injustices faced by lower-caste students, from being mocked
for their accent to enduring public humiliation, such as being smeared
with sludge.

## Review

Shazia Iqbal sets a serious tone from the start with a grim scene
depicting caste-based violence, immediately establishing the stakes of
the story. Nilesh's journey is both heart-wrenching and inspiring, as he
navigates oppression while gradually asserting his identity. The film
touches on several social issues, including casteism, student politics,
and societal hierarchies, without shying away from their harsh
realities.

The romantic arc between Nilesh and Vidhi, while central, feels slightly
underdeveloped in contrast to the intense social commentary. Written by
Iqbal and Rahul Badwelkar, the narrative sometimes dwells repetitively
on Nilesh's oppression, yet the story remains engaging through its
sincere portrayal of injustice and resilience.

Moments of levity, humor, and warmth are sprinkled throughout, balancing
the otherwise grim tone. The pacing is steady, and the direction by
Iqbal is effective, although the final resolution feels somewhat
restrained. The music is a standout, with Siddharth--Garima's soulful
*Duniya Alag* and Javed--Mohsin's touching *Bas Ek Dhadak* adding
emotional depth to the narrative.

## Performances

Siddhant Chaturvedi delivers a career-defining performance, portraying
Nilesh's evolution from a timid student to a confident young man with
subtlety and conviction. Triptii Dimri impresses as the empathetic
Vidhi, while Vipin Sharma makes a strong impact in his brief role as
Nilesh's father. Supporting performances, including Zakir Hussain as the
college dean, further enhance the film's authenticity and emotional
weight.

## Final Verdict

**Dhadak 2** is a heart‑rending and thought-provoking film that
addresses a socially relevant issue with sincerity and sensitivity.
While the romantic subplot could have been fleshed out more, the movie
succeeds as a socially conscious drama anchored by a stellar performance
from Siddhant Chaturvedi. It's an engaging watch for those who
appreciate films with depth, social relevance, and emotional resonance.
